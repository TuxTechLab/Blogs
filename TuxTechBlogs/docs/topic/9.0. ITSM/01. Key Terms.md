## **Key ITSM Terms**

You’ll come across a host of terms related to ITIL, ITSM, DevOps, and Digital Transformation. You'll need to have a working understanding of the terms below as you progress through this training.

## **Industry Terms**
| **Industry Terms** | **Definition** |
| ---- | :----|
| `Digital Transformation`  |**Digital Transformation** is the use of new, fast and frequently changing digital technology to solve problems. One of the examples of digital transformation is cloud computing. It reduces reliance on user owned hardware and increases reliance on subscription-based cloud services.|
| `DevOPs` | **DevOps** emphasizes accelerated IT service delivery enabled by agile and lean practices. DevOps improves collaboration between development and IT operations teams, so organizations can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably. The promised benefits include increased trust, faster software releases, an ability to solve critical issues quickly, and better management of unplanned work.|
| <ol><li>`Lean`</li><li>`SAFe`</li><li>`Agile`</li><li>`Scrum`</li></ol>    | <ol><li>**Lean IT** involves a methodology of value-stream mapping — diagramming and analyzing services (value streams) into their component process steps and eliminating any steps (or even entire value streams) that do not deliver value.</li><li>The **Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)**, methodology is an agile framework for development teams built on three pillars: Team, Program, and Portfolio. It is designed not so much as a single methodology, but as a broad knowledge base of proven best practices that real teams have used to deliver successful software products.</li><li>**Agile methodology** is a practice that promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle of the project. Both development and testing activities are concurrent unlike the Waterfall model. Agile software development emphasizes on four core values.</li><li>**Scrum** is an agile process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies.</li></ol> |
| <ol><li>`AWS`</li><li>`Microsoft Azure`</li><li>`Google Cloud Platform`</li></ol>|<ol><li>**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis.</li><li>**Microsoft Azure** is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.</li><li>**Google Cloud Platform**, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail and YouTube</li></ol>|
| `I&O ( Infrastructure & Operations )`| **Infrastructure and Operations (1&0)** manages the ITS data centers and provides around-the-clock support for ITS business computing activities. |

## **ITSM Terms**
| **ITSM Terms** | **Definition** |
| :----: | :---- |
|<ol><li>`Service Request`</li><li>`Incident Management`</li><li>`Problem Management`</li><li>`Knowledge and Asset Management`</li><li>`Change Enablement ( Formerly known as Change Management )`</li><li>`Configuration and Database Management ( CMDB )`</li></ol>| <ol><li>**Service Request Management** is a repeatable procedure for handling the wide variety of customer service requests, like requests for access to applications, software enhancements, and hardware updates. The service request workstream often involves recurring requests and benefits greatly from enabling customers with knowledge and automating certain tasks.</li><li>**Incident Management** is the practice of managing unplanned events that disrupt or reduce the quality of a service. It requires an emergency response from the IT team.</li><li>**Problem Management** is the practice of identifying and managing the causes of incidents on an IT service. It is a core component of ITSM frameworks.</li><li>**Knowledge Management** is the practice of creating, curating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge across an organization and even across industries. **IT Asset Management (also known as ITAM)** is the process of ensuring an organization’s assets are accounted for, deployed, maintained, upgraded, and disposed of when the time comes. Put simply, it’s making sure that the valuable items, tangible and intangible, in your organization are tracked and being used.</li><li>**Change Enablement** is an IT practice designed to minimize disruptions to IT services while making changes to critical systems and services. A change is adding, modifying, or removing anything that could have a direct or indirect effect on services.</li><li>According to ITIL 4, a **configuration management database (CMDB)** “is used to store configuration records throughout their lifecycle and maintain the relationships between them. In other words, your CMDB stores information on the configuration of items within an organization, including hardware, software, systems, facilities, and sometimes personnel. It is the purview of the IT organization to define which items should be tracked and how to do so. This configuration data can include relationships and interdependencies between items, the history of changes to each item, and class and attributes—such as type, owner, and importance—for each item.</li></ol>|
| <ol><li>`Self-Service`</li><li>`Shift-left`</li></ol> | <ol><li>As users come to depend on self-service applications to find answers or ask for help in their daily lives, these expectations for self-service are now being applied to IT organizations. Self-service isn't a new concept, either. We see it in our everyday lives, from self-checkout lines to using an ATM. And now, finding answers is easier than ever with the power of search engines.</li><li>The ability to **"shift-left"** and deliver quality self-service is a top priority for many IT organizations today. Increasing support consist Level Three, Two, One, Zero Support. Shift left (lower cost & improved user satisfaction)</li></ol> |
|`Always-On-Service`| A Service which is consumed/ available to consumers to be consumed anytime 24X7, 365 days. |
| <ol><li>`ITIL`</li><li>`ITIL4`</li></ol>| <ol><li>**ITIL** is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on practices for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help organizations adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.</li><li>**ITIL4**, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT tears. It guides teams to a holistic, business and customer-value frame of reference, and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.
