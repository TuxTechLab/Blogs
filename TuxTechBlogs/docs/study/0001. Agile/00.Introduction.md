## **What comes to mind when you think of the word "agility?"**

- Agility is the ability to move with quick, effortless grace.
- You can be agile in the way you work, too. Every day, you can approach your tasks with grace and efficiency.
- Agile  is a set of ideas, frameworks, and tools to help you manage work more efficiently.
- The agile ideas encourage you to:
    1. **Be flexible** and ready for unpredictable change
    2. **Communicate** often with stakeholders
    3. **Ship work** in short increments (instead of all at once)
    4. **Always be learning.**
- Agile isn't just about following a process. It's about having the right **attitude** and **mindset.**

Being agile allows your team to **prioritize the most critical work** and **get it done efficiently**, ultimately **delivering value to customers more quickly.**

## **How is agile different from traditional project management?**

| First, you define requirements thoroughly before the project begins. Then, you complete each phase of the project in sequential order. At the end, one significant deliverable is completed and shipped.|You stay flexible and respond quickly to changing requirements. You prioritize the work items that create the most value for your customers. Deliverables are completed and shipped continuously, in small increments.|

## **Where did agile come from?**

- Agile was created to solve a problem. In 2001, a group of tech professionals were frustrated with how software was being built. They felt the traditional waterfall approach was too slow, rigid, and inefficient.The group spent a weekend in the mountains and came up with a new approach to managing software projects. They called it _The Agile Manifesto_.
- This short, **68-word document** provided new guidelines for building software. It suggested teams prioritize **flexibility**, **constant communication** with stakeholders, and **continuous delivery of work** in short increments.

- Twenty years later, the ways of working suggested in _The Agile Manifesto_ continue to drive many of the world's highest-performing teams, including a majority of software developers.
- **But, agile isn't only for software teams.** Remote work has fueled a boom in agile adoption across various teams and organizations, from law firms to marketing agencies.
- **Agile project management can help any team be more nimble, efficient, and flexible** depending on your team structure and deliverables.
