# Maturity Matters

Not all businesses are ready for the complexity of a global launch. Maturity, training, documented practices, and scale play a huge role in what a team can accomplish. In the same way, not all IT organizations can offer the full breadth of IT Services covered in the previous sections.

> ## **Why does maturity matter?**

The maturity of an IT organization will impact the ITIL practices they're able to implement, and what they'll need from an ITSM solution. Check this diagram for ITSM maturity model:

## **ITSM Maturity Model**

- The Gartner IT Maturity Model (image above ⬆️) is a useful tool to assess an IT team's current maturity. The lower maturity teams are typically more chaotic with ad hoc requests and undocumented processes. _Service Request Management_ might be a huge part of their day, but they don't have great processes in place for _Change Enablement_.
- The more the teams mature, the more process and value-driven they get. They're able to offer _Incident Management_ and _Problem Management_. The team may begin implementing a workflow framework to shape their processes, like ITIL.
- Every team wants to be on the complex service and value end of the scale. They must work through organizational process or technology challenges to achieve this goal.
- **Effective organizations want IT delivered as a solution based service.**
