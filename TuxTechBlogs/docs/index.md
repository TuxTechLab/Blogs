🙏 Welcome To [**TuxTechBlogs**](./index.md), This website is created to share study materials & notes related to Computer Science Engineering and its' domains which are popular these days.

🏹 **TuxTechBlogs** is to be a one-stop shop for programmers, both experienced and amateurs alike to brush up their programming & Computer Science skills. The repository contains well documented mini-blogs for a vast variety of programming problems.


🔥 Programming problems from some of the best online judges [Leetcode](https://www.leetcode.com), [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com), [InterviewBit](https://https://www.interviewbit.com) etc.

🎉 Each problem has an intuition section, followed by the algorithm and the pseudo-code, and finally the implementation. Additionally, the problems are embellished with explanatory images and animations to provide clarity of thought.

✏️ For now, we are accepting solutions in Python,Java & C++ for the problem solving questions. Contributions are always welcome for solutions in other programming languages. Looking for **JS, Go, Kotlin** contributors.
