Cards are the key \"visual   signals\" on a kanban board. They help your team track the progress of work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each card provides additional information about the work item, such as the due date, assignee, and attachments.</p> </li> <li> <p>Cards are assigned an owner responsible for the work.

When a column reaches its maximum, this is a warning sign that the team has over-committed too much work.</p> </li> <li> <p>For example, a team could set maximum for the In Progress column to two. The team determines both minimum and maximum limits based on how much work they can handle.</p> </li> <li> <p>Why have limits? Many reasons! First, it prevents multitasking and improves focus by having the team work on a smaller set of tasks.

What's the outcome you're trying to get to? Are you trying to collaborate on a problem? Are you trying to share information with soemone else? Really getting to kind of the crux of what it means to actually succeed in this meeting. What's the outcome we want to get to?</p> </li> <li> <p>Number two, what's the best way to achieve this? You always default to a meeting, so you have to change that behavior. Maybe it could be an instant message. It could be Confluence page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Suppose you work with a team right now that actually spends most of its time in different parts of the globe which is really hard for you to collaborate. So what you done is kind of come up with new ways to collaborate that doesn't involve a meeting.</p> </li> <li> <p>You use things like Confluence to actually co-create documentation around the globe around, you know around the clock. And then use tools like Loom/ Youtube/ Diagram/ Confluence KB to allow us to kind of go and express maybe our thoughts on what's going on.</p> </li> <li> <p>What have I done in the last week or what have I done since yesterday and be able to share that back because it's a lot easier than maybe writing something down or trying to articulate an idea. That's just too complex.</p> </li> <li> <p>These Loom videos and Confluence pages to give an opportunity to kind of figure out how do you want to work the next day and then that way we have only certain touch points.</p> </li> <li> <p>You need to worry about with each other versus trying to have a daily meeting to stay in sync. And finally the third thing you need to think about: who actually needs to be at that meeting?</p> </li> <li> <p>Are you meeting with a person or are you meeting with a group? If you're meeting with a person, is this something that you need to have a meeting for or is it best done through an instant message or some sort of other collaboration means?</p> </li> <li> <p>If it's a group, what are you trying to share? Are you just trying to share information? If you're just trying to share information, maybe that's also done better through sharing out something like a Confluence page and a Loom.</p> </li> <li> <p>Again, when you're thinking about the meetings that you have today, don't default to just have the meeting. Think about how could  do this a little differently?</p> </li> <li> <p>If I need help answering these questions, Atlassian has actually come up with kind of a cheeky, fun view of how we can better identify whether or not we need to have a meeting. They call it the \"why do I want to call this meeting?\" decision tree. So if you walk through it, it kind of gives you these fun areas to say maybe I'm trying to share information or maybe I want to build relationships.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>And it starts asking me some questions like is this a one-on-one is this just trying to push information out there and it helps you kind of determine whether or not you actually need to hold this meeting.</p> <ul> <li>For example, you probably don't need to have a meeting to let's say read through the contents of a Confluence page you just sent. Or if you just don't know any other way to collaborate. Trust me, there are other ways to collaborate that don't involve a meeting.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Now the thing is, is this chart is great. It's fun. It's something that Atlassian use. But based on your organizational behaviors your cultural behaviors in your organization, you may actually want to come up with your own.</p> </li> <li> <p>Work with the organization or even just your own team to create a meeting decision tree of your own in order to improve your meeting culture. You can then use your decision tree as a working agreement to eliminate unnecessary meetings and promote better meeting behaviors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Again, find what works best for you. I usually try to lead with if I couldn't have a meeting for this how else could I get it accomplished?

This stage is all about doing the right pre-work and sharing that out with your participants before the meeting ever starts.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pre-work is essential for transforming your meetings and preventing unnecessary waste.</p> </li> <li> <p>And so as we think about preparing for a meeting, there's a couple things you need to keep in mind. When you actually say \"I need this meeting,\" the first thing you do is not set up the meeting.</p> </li> <li> <p>The first thing you need to do before you send anything out: build an agenda. What are the topics you want to cover in this agenda? This goes back to that idea being very intentful with your time, thinking about the outcomes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Focus on time boxing the agendas. Focus in on doing things like maybe setting aside 10 to 15 minute increments for each item on your agenda. Anything more than that and people might find themselves kind of drifting off or you might start wandering off topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>Within your agenda, make sure you've identify what's the outcome for each one of those topics? Yes, I want to present on something, but why am I presenting it? Again am I information sharing? Am I trying to make a decision with this group? Am I trying to gather ideas?</p> </li> <li> <p>Be very explicit and then also identify who's going to own that topic. Who is going to help drive that conversation. Even though you may be the facilitator, someone is presenting that topic and your role is to help ensure that we hit that outcome and maintain that time box.</p> <pre><code>![MEETING_kickoff_agenda](https://i.postimg.cc/Hs2Q6Nqx/MEETING-kickoff-agenda.png)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Now this goes back down to again the intent of the meeting. What are you trying to do? Don't blast out that invite to multiple people and just hope you get the right folks. For every person you add to the invite, make sure you ask yourself the question what's in it for this person to spend time in my meeting versus going somewhere else or doing something else.</p> </li> <li> <p>The thing is if you say well they just need to be here, that's not a good enough answer. Go through and say well, what is their role gonna be in this meeting? Are they gonna help me make a decision? Do I need their expertise in something? Or are they part of a team that I need to share information with?</p> </li> <li> <p>Again be very explicit with who you're bringing and why. And at that point, that's when you can invite them. That way they recognize this is the role I'm going to play versus \"Hey, should I be here?\"</p> </li> <li> <p>And so once you've actually built out your agenda, you've actually figured out who needs to attend then and only then should you go ahead and send out an invite.</p> </li> <li> <p>In that invite make sure that in the description. Either included the actual copy and paste agenda or you've included a link to something like a Confluence page.</p> </li> <li> <p>Never ever ever send a meeting invite with that says \"Agenda to come.\" That is just a way to cop out of actually putting together that agenda doing that preparation.</p> </li> <li> <p>As you're getting prepared for your meeting, are there any other tools or tips to use?</p> </li> <li> <p>To me all goes back to again, what do you want to try to achieve in the meeting? What's the intent of the meeting?</p> </li> <li> <p>If you're having a one-way information sharing meeting, tools like PowerPoint and Keynote are great for that. They help convey information very well to an audience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now if you're in a more of a collaborative meeting, maybe you're trying to make a decision or maybe you're just trying to brainstorm things. There's other tools out there.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confluence is really good for sharing information and allowing people to kind of review and collaborate on it. Tools like Mural/ draw.io are really great whiteboarding tools that allow you to go in and actually have some rapid brainstorming.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can even use polling tools like Slido or Mentimeter. These are great tools that I've found in my meetings that I like to employ at certain times to kind of get the poll of the room. Especially in a large group on a certain question that I have.</p> </li> <li> <p>So think creatively about how you can use tools to one engage your audience. But then also make sure when you're using those tools you're using them with intent.</p> </li> <li> <p>You're not just using them because you can. And another pro tip here is if you're going to use these tools, make sure you get those tools prepped beforehand.</p> </li> <li> <p>I hate going into a meeting and someone's like, \"Oh look, we're gonna review this Confluence page and I don't know where it is.\" Be prepared. Link that in your agenda. What are we going to review, where we gonna do it?</p> </li> <li> <p>At the end, sharing Minutes of Meeting (MoM) to the attendees helps to keep the context with target audience. Also if any to-do/ pending action to be taken by you/ someone else can be specified in follow up mail once the meeting is over.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"topic/13.1.%20Management/00.%20Run%20Effective%20Meetings/05.%20Facilitation/","title":"Phase: Meeting Facilitation","text":"<ul> <li>Phase: Meeting Facilitation</li> <li>Facilitation phase</li> <li>How to facilitate a meeting?</li> <li>Tips to keep in mind as you facilitate</li> </ul>"},{"location":"topic/13.1.%20Management/00.%20Run%20Effective%20Meetings/05.%20Facilitation/#facilitation-phase","title":"Facilitation phase","text":"<ol> <li> <p>So you made it.

A good way to get them engaged in a positive way is ask them to be the note-taker.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have them being engaged and the whole flow of the meeting by being that note-taker. And it's one of the things that will help keep them focused on something that's adding value to that meeting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be the facilitator. This means that in the conversation, make sure you're putting that facilitator hat on and not necessarily jumping into the content.</p> </li> <li> <p>A lot of times, the facilitator can get themselves deep into a conversation and then all of a sudden, 15, 20, 30 minutes goes by because they're so deep in the conversation that they forgot to pay attention to the clock.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you find that you're in a topic that you need to engage with, actually ask your group, \"I need someone to play facilitator for the next topic because I need to engage in that.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Get someone to be that timekeeper, that person who's gonna keep you focused. It's huge because it'll also again show that you respect people's time and want to get to all the topics.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure you know when to break the rules. I say this because one of the things that you probably seen in meetings is you get a facilitator who is running a meeting by the book, when something maybe truly more pressing comes up. And says \"Nope, we got to keep your schedule.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Knowing when to break the rules and how to ask the team permission to break the rules is key be willing to kind of sense and adapt as you go.</p> </li> <li> <p>Again use your rules as your guide, but don't be so rigid in those that all the sudden you lead people in the end to still feel like we didn't cover the right thing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Some of my best meetings have come out in the end where they said, you know what I'm glad we switch to that topic because we needed to at that point.</p> </li> <li> <p>So just a few things to keep in mind as you're facilitating. It's your responsibility to be a good listener. Be aware of the conversation going on and help advance discussion when needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Know how to draw your participants back in if things start to wander a bit and be mindful the topics and time just to make sure everything stays on track.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Going back to the four principles.

You know, someone's talking here things are happening there.</p> <ol> <li> <p>As a facilitator, it's your job to help kind of maintain the flow of the meeting but the same time create an environment where everyone feels like they can talk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's take a look into \ud83d\udc49  the Atlassian Team Playbook play called inclusive meetings. And it's all about how do we set ground rules for our meetings? And these are rules in terms of like how do we want to collaborate?</p> </li> <li> <p>You might have examples like \"Hey, we're gonna raise our hand when we want to speak.\" Or for every topic, we're gonna hold questions until the end of that topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>As a facilitator you are accountable and responsible for creating an inclusive environment in your meeting so that everyone feels like they can contribute.</p> </li> <li> <p>Look for feedback afterwards to determine whether or not in that meeting everybody felt like they could get a voice. And use your intuition. Sometimes you can see that hey, you know got a couple people that are always quiet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kind of look and say what can I do to change my environment help make meetings better in the future?</p> </li> <li> <p>My biggest recommendation to help keep attendees engaged is one use time boxes in your agenda. And two, follow those sign boxes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Keeping attendees engaged is going to come back to honoring their time saying this is our agenda. These are what we're going to talk about and this is when we're going to talk about it.</p> </li> <li> <p>This really important to help keep in participants engaged. I can't tell you how many times I get into a meeting and we have 10 minutes on a topic and I look at my watch in 20 minutes have gone by and we're still on that topic.</p> </li> <li> <p>For me, I feel that facilitator isn't doing their job and I'm like, apparently the rest of these topics don't matter. Final tip for keeping people engaged on a meeting: use the power of a parking lot.</p> </li> <li> <p>Many times we get into meetings and we find ourselves derailing a topic a little bit with a new topic. Well as a facilitator go in there and say hey, that's a great topic. Let's add it to our parking lot.</p> </li> <li> <p>If we have time maybe you've set aside time at the end of your agenda for other topics Or you need to set up a separate meeting. This allows again participants to feel that you value their time and you want them to get to the outcomes that they originally attended to get to in that meeting.</p> </li> <li> <p>When it comes time to end the meeting, maybe you're in the last five minutes of it. There's nothing worse than getting to the end of the meeting where your midway through a conversation and now you're just having to leave.</p> </li> <li> <p>I always want to make sure I save 5 or 10 minutes on that agenda. It kind of closes out the meeting. Honor that time box make sure that you have that 5 to 10 minutes to review a couple things.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure you review the goal of the meeting - did we accomplish this? I actually like to ask my participants, you know up or down on your with your thumbs. Did we hit the outcome did we get to the place?</p> </li> <li> <p>We wanted to get to also make sure you go back and look at your action items do we have owners assigned to them? Do we have due dates on those? Have people agreed to take those on?</p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure you take care of those so that way people leaving say, \"Cool the things that we need help with, they are going to get done.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>And then finally make sure you go back and look at the decisions you've made as well. Make sure you say, \"Hey in this meeting, we we made the decisions on A, B, and C.\" Just as a reminder to the group that says cool, these are the things that we decided.</p> </li> <li> <p>This also will help solidify for your participants that hey we actually got some value out of this meeting. We actually were able to get from A to B, which is more than maybe we've gotten to in the past.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"topic/13.1.%20Management/00.%20Run%20Effective%20Meetings/07.%20Follow-up/","title":"Phase: Follow Up","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Congratulations, you have made it. You completed your meeting. Now, the game's not over with yet. That's the thing. You remember that you've got preparation, facilitation, participation, and now we're in follow-up.</p> </li> <li> <p>All about closing this out. When at the end of a meeting, you need to determine how effective that meeting was. What I like to do to determine it whether or not a meeting is effective is save a few minutes at the very end of the meeting to maybe ask the audience.</p> </li> <li> <p>Maybe there's good psychological safety in your group and because of that you can actually ask people, \"Hey, how was this meeting? Did you like it? Was it effective? Was it valuable?\"</p> </li> <li> <p>Other techniques you can use that I've used in the past. If you're in a room on the whiteboard or if you're digital, maybe you're using a Trello board,  create a scale one to five. One, this was not a very effective use of my time, I wish I was doing something else. And five being, this was the best use of my time possible, I'm so glad I was here.</p> </li> <li> <p>As people leave physically in the room have a mark on that whiteboard where they're at. If they are digital have them go ahead and vote on one of those cards one to five. And again that just gives you information in terms of hey did people feel that this was an effective meeting or not?</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"topic/13.1.%20Management/00.%20Run%20Effective%20Meetings/07.%20Follow-up/#whats-the-best-way-to-follow-up-with-your-participants","title":"what's the best way to follow up with your participants?","text":"<ul> <li> <p>So once your meeting is over, let's say it was an effective meeting. Let's say you did all the right stuff. Everyone's like \"Yeah, that was great.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>The first thing you've got to do after that meeting is done go out there and make sure you send out those meeting notes. Share it with the participants as well as those people who maybe you just need to inform what was covered in that meeting.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tell them what decisions were made, what actions we're taking. And most importantly, for those folks who took actions, make sure that they're aware of those especially.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you know, they need to have some sort of tracking of those, great tools like Confluence allow you to actually mention somebody in it and actually sends them a notification that says \"Hey, you got this action.\"</p> </li> <li> <p>And most importantly, after let's say a few days of that meeting, follow up. Make sure things like actions are taken care of. One of the things I like to do is if I have a regular occurring meeting, what I'll do is at the beginning of every agenda will actually have a line item to look back at prior action items.</p> </li> <li> <p>Have we taken care of those which ones are due which ones aren't? It leads to a lot of accountability on the people who actually took those actions and it really helps move that meeting forward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now if you're finding you're having an ineffective meeting so okay. Don't beat yourself up for it. It happens to all of us and the goal here is just to get better.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So a couple things you can do here is one go actually ask some folks. You know have some one-on-one sessions saying, \"Hey, I'd love to get better at running effective meetings. What feedback do you have for me?\"</p> <p>Figure out what could make meetings better than the next time and experiment with that. Another thing you can do is, let's say it's a meeting that's on a regular basis.</p> <p>Do what we call a ritual reset here at Atlassian. If you go to our Team Playbook, you'll find the ritual reset play. It's a fantastic play that allows you to kind of take a meta view of your meetings.</p> <p>And saying hey if I were to reexamine all these meetings, what would I keep because I think they're super valuable? What would I maybe change because I still need that but something needs to change? And ultimately what should I get rid of? Maybe that could be more of an email. What could be async here?</p> <p>Actually a great story for you here is I have a customer I've been working with in telecom that actually found themselves in need of kind of fixing up some of their meetings.</p> <p>What ended up happening is they said you know, what? We'd love to try this ritual reset play out. And so they actually went and spent about an hour, which is all the time it takes running through that play.</p> <p>And the next day I actually got an email from that team that says, \"Hey, I just want to say running this play kind of changed our perspective on how we meet. It allowed us to really take a look and say is this meeting worthwhile or should we change it up? Should we remove it?\"</p> <p>And from there, they were able to kind of really change how they work together all of a sudden now, they've introduced some new ways of working. They've opened up their minds saying we can collaborate differently.</p> <p>So explore things like our ritual reset because it's incredibly powerful to actually look and say, \"Hey, is this the best use of our time?\" And maybe it is, let's get a little bit better at it.</p>"},{"location":"topic/13.2.%20Miscellaneous/acronym/","title":"Acronyms","text":"<ul> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>D</li> <li>E</li> <li>F</li> <li>G</li> <li>H</li> <li>I</li> <li>J</li> <li>K</li> <li>L</li> <li>M</li> <li>N</li> <li>O</li> <li>P</li> <li>Q</li> <li>R</li> <li>S</li> <li>T</li> <li>U</li> <li>V</li> <li>W</li> <li>X</li> <li>Y</li> <li>Z</li> </ul>"},{"location":"topic/13.2.%20Miscellaneous/acronym/#a","title":"A","text":"<ul> <li><code>AWS</code>     -
